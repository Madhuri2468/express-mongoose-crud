Setup a Full CRUD REST API with Express and Mongoose
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to develop a full CRUD REST API (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Express and Mongoose to manage student records in a MongoDB database.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Setup Project

Create a Node.js project and install dependencies:

mkdir express-mongoose-crud
cd express-mongoose-crud
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose body-parser

2. Create Schema & Model

Connect to MongoDB (schoolDB) using Mongoose.

Define a Student schema with fields:

name (String, required)

rollNo (Number, required, unique)

branch (String)

year (Number)

email (String)

Create a Student model from the schema.

3. Build CRUD Routes

Implement API routes:

POST /students â†’ Create a student record

GET /students â†’ Read all students

GET /students/:id â†’ Read a single student by ID

PUT /students/:id â†’ Update a student by ID

DELETE /students/:id â†’ Delete a student by ID

4. Run the Project

Start the server:

node app.js


Open your browser or API client at http://localhost:3000.
